numpy: $ pip3 install numpy

To run the program:
$ python3 problem1.py

Also included is a shell script that the user can run
to execute the program
$ ./install.sh

For Problem 2:
Change the variable power for n in 2^n x 2^n matrix
ex: for 2^9 x 2^9, power = 9

run the main method and it will display the times for naive and strassen methods
